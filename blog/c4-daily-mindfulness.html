          <h2>In Conversation</h2>
          <p>
            Something I've wanted to do for a while is connect with someone living on the street, hear their perspective 
            on life and their own position. When I pass someone begging in the street I never know how to behave.
            How much need are they in? Do they have places to go? How did they get there? 
            <br><em>I set myself a challenge here 
            to go out and share lunch with someone I pass who's begging and listen to them for a while...</em>
            <br><br>
            This was really interesting. I walked down Cuba st until I saw someone with a hat out and asked if they wanted some lunch.
            I sat down to eat sushi with them and did my best to listen to whatever they said, asking as little as possible. Some things I noticed:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <p>
                  I started finding what they were saying more interesting the more deliberately and carefully I listened.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                I noticed that at each point where I could have said something, 
                but instead stayed waiting and listening, or asked a relevant question, they could tell I was paying attention and they started to
                speak more openly.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                It was initially a bit uncomfortable for me and maybe for them (who is this guy?), but that didn't last long, afterwards I felt like there'd been a real point of connection.
                It didn't matter so much that we were different people, that there was no reason for us to speak, we could just talk person to person without 
                need for more context than that.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                If someone's telling me their opinion on something, I find it actually quite hard to listen if I disagree, it depends how strongly 
                I feel about the subject, but it doesn't take much. I start having an urge to reply and convince them to 
                see things another way.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                After a while I was thinking about leaving and heading back. I noticed that as long as I felt like I was staying in conversation by choice, 
                listening was easier. A few moments I wanted to leave but had to wait for an opening and wasn't there by choice, as soon as this happened I stopped taking in 
                what they were saying.
              </p>
            </li>
          </ul>
          <h2>Which of the suggested techniques will you use?</h2>
          <p>
            I enjoyed the walking. Especially taking a break from coding, going out and just wandering about town slowly, 
            paying attention to my body and also surroundings, the people passing. Maybe in what I did my attention was more outward than what was suggested, 
            but I really enjoyed it. Going to be wandering some more.
            <br><br>
            Also... <blockquote>Do less than you can.</blockquote>
            Going to put this on my wall. I think it's equally important 
            to push limits and capacity at times. But for the long game, taking action that supports curiousity, enjoyment and drive is much more important than pushing hard 
            for short term growth or gain if it's going to erode that core motivation.
          </p>
          <h2>Other musings</h2>
          <p>
            At times I'm reading thinking 'I know this already, this can't offer me anything.' And in a way I have already been exposed 
            to the ideas, but in practise meditation/mindfulness has felt inaccessible for a while and coming into contact with a basic re-introduction through this 
            book and possibly knowing that I'm connected to a group that's also doing their own experiments - I'm finding it feels a bit more workable and enjoyable again.
            <br><br>
            The term 'mindfulness' feels bloated with association. I find myself not wanting to write it even! I'd rather write 'attentive listening' than 
            'mindful listening'. I've heard much more talk than I've seen good examples of it and I get sick of hearing it.
