          <h2>What is your experience with compassionate Leadership</h2>
          <p>
            Once I interviewed for a job that would mean moving cities which I wasn't really that 
            keen on. My friend already worked for the company so I combined visiting him with a day in the office for me to meet with his boss 
            and see a day in the life.
            <br><br>
            I didn't end up pursuing it because of the required move. As I was leaving myt friends Boss said something like "Well good to meet you, you have a lot to give 
            and I hope you find your place to put it out". Even though I wasn't going to work there this person expressed a genuine warm interest in my search 
            for meaningful work in the world, it had a huge impact.
          </p>
          <p>
            Probably the least compassionate experience I have had was the cafe owner I wrote about in the <a href="./c8-connecting.html">last blog</a>.
            As far as I could tell they had very little interest in the experience of their staff. I think they were just under a lot of stress and their idea of 
            a working relationship was about expectation and command only, which I guess is no problem in itself if you know what you're in for.
          </p>
          <h2>Multiplying Goodness and Tong-Len</h2>
          <p>
            I found the discussion about the challenge of Tonglen really applicable to my own reaction from the previous chapter.
            I find it tough to get in touch with suffering and it makes sense that 'confidence in the transformative power of self' or I guess 
            the power of people to alleviate their own and others suffering is crucial to the task. Perhaps I can build up to this.
            <br><br>
            I did the first multiplying goodness a couple of times. The first time I struggled to engage. The second my imagination came more into play 
            and I could picture myself and others more clearly giving and receiving kindness. I really enjoyed it. Though I really think to increase confidence in transformative power 
            it would take action as well, visualising then enacting some kindness, seeing it's effect and repeating.
            <br><br>
            When I tried Tonglen I found that when I was visualising myself inhaling darkness, even though I know the point of the exercise is to feel transformative 
            power, I have a sense that it will deplete me and make me sick, or that there is too much to deal with. I'd be curious to see how this could change. I've had this experience 
            with Tonglen before but I'd never come across the idea of having a bridging exercise towards it.
          </p>
          <h2>SCARF</h2>
          <p>
            This was great to read. I could relate to a lot. It makes sense that a seemingly benign interaction can trigger a threat response in someone because it represents 
            a possible change in their sense of social place. I definitely experience a high level of stress when one or several of these are thrown into question, 
            often I find it hard to place or make sense of the source of stress. 
            <br><br>
            This section also feels like it ties in heavily with the undercurrent conversations in a difficult conversation. Like the hidden conversations of identity going on, there will also be hidden social questions in play,
            'where do I now stand with this person?', 'Am I welcome here?' that might need attention.
            <br><br>
            Socially phase-0 has felt uncomfortable to me at times because it is still an approaching unknown, I guess that is 
            a lack of certainty, but also it's been nice connecting with other students through zoom or in person. After each point of contact with 
            the other students or one of the EDA staff or others working at the office there's a sense of that discomfort dissapating.
          </p>
          <h3>Progressing to the main course</h3>
          <p>
            Going from phase-0 to bootcamp will be an interesting transition. We'll be pulling away from our habitual social nets 
            and going into a silo for a couple of months. Maybe there'll be questions at the start for everyone about how to act with one another, I guess those are questions of status. 
            I expect there will be a lot of opportunity to relate and connect seeing as it'll be quite an intense period. It could be a challenge to autonomy to be in the student role at times?
            <br><br>
            I'm guessing questions around social certainty will fall to the background during the bootcamp with all structure and contact provided and make a come back when the process 
            finishes as each of us searches for new roles and applications of their skills.
          </p>
          <h2>Difficult Conversation</h2>
          <p>
            I haven't done this but I'm going to reminisce.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li><p>
              It's super hard to stick to my guns! Not that guns are a good analogy, difficult conversations being a peacemaking mission... If I have a specific point of conflict or something that I take issue with, once the conversation starts I will sometimes back down from saying what 
              I feel I need to say in order to avoid 'disturbing the peace'. What I could be doing is saying it all while also addressing the hidden layers that it might bring up for the other person, leaving less room for it to feel threatening either way. My nature is to fall into people pleasing a lot of the time, which can be hard to reign in
            </p></li>
            <li><p>
              Conversely, when I'm on the receiving end I sometimes take something that's said too personally, or read falsely into it, this is like the flip case, just takes a reminder that 
              those under layers are active and to separate them from what's actually being said or requested.
            </p></li>
            <li><p>
              I think it's important to remember that though on the outset these positions seem very difficult or unlikely to resolve, there's almost always 
              a way for everyone to get what they want, and there's definitely always a way for people to leave feeling fully respected and understood, even if a collective compromise 
              is reached where individuals don't get their ideal.
