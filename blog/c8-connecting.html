          <h2>Empathic Listening</h2>
          <p>
            It was nice to spend some time deliberately trying to follow someone elses felt experience, I could do with more of it. As with some other 
            exercises in this book it feels like an innate capacity that I take for granted, I'm not used to thinking of my ability to empathise 
            as something that can be deliberately stretched, like learning to walk better or something like that.
            <br><br>
            At times I lost some distinction between the speakers emotional current and my own, especially if I was relating through a similar experience I'd had,
            this meant my listening was clouded to some degree. I guess that is where 'dipping' would help, being able to keep a handle on internal response 
            and decouple that from what I'm hearing.
            <br><br>
            I felt like I had distinct difficulty putting into words what I had perceived, so when I was looping back to the speaker some of what I had heard 
            was lost or distorted in my trying to explain.
            <br><br>
            It seemed like I had a damper or buffer going on, I could intellectualise what they were feeling more than I could actually connect directly to it. At 
            least that is what it felt like.
          </p>
          <h2>Loving Kindness Meditation</h2>
          <p>
            I found this pretty tricky. Especially turning my attention to others. I started thinking of all the hard things that people 
            go through and wishing them all well felt a bit like flicking little drops of water on a house fire. But I liked the exercise, I think with practise
            my experience of it might change and the sense of generosity enclosing everything might get stronger. 
            <br><br> 
            Trying to extend to everyone made me reflect that in order to really be kind 
            I have to acknowledge that amongst everything there is a huge amount of hardship in the world, and as far as I can tell that will always be the case, if that's true kindness has to come from a place that 
            doesn't demand that suffering go away, it's got to be patient and tolerant in a way.
            <br><br>
            There was a big element of shying away from that collective hardship, not wanting to get in contact with it and feel it, especially knowing 
            there was no way to quickly resolve it, it felt like opening pandoras box. When it comes down to it I am quite disturbed by the human capacity to suffer, to me this exercise stares that aspect
            of life right in the face.

          <h2>Political Awareness</h2>
          <p>
            Here's a little rundown of a conflict I had last year.
          </p>
          <ol>
            <li><p>
              <strong>My view</strong><br><br>
              <i> 
                I was working at a cafe where the owner under a fair bit of stress. Periodically they 
                would show up and work alongside everyone. This was precarious at best, we were all walking on eggshells as our treatment as staff was very much subject 
                to the owners moods, if they were stressed out they would take it out on everyone. They had cameras all through the cafe and would 
                watch us remotely at random times.
                <br><br>
                I took issue with how they were treating people but as it was the first similar role I'd had I didn't know what to expect 
                or if it was normal. I was also certain that telling them I had a problem with their treatment of the staff would mean losing my job.
                <br><br>
                In the end the owner was especially harsh on the supervisor I was working under and I felt it was pretty unfair and could be described as bullying 
                one afternoon I stayed after closing to talk with both of them. I was pretty annoyed at the time from the built up stress of working for this person
                and I spoke my mind. 
                <br>I was fired the next day. Looking back I think the tension was beyond the ability of either of us to have a reasoned discussion. I didn't feel like I spoke clearly 
                or calmly and the owner definitely had no ears for criticism. I felt a bit disgusted but also relieved to get 
                out of there.
              </i>
            </p></li>
            <li><p>
              <strong>The other side of the story (maybe).</strong><br><br>
              <i>
                I took a big risk hiring and training a new staff member Stanley with little hospitality experience for the cafe. He seems to be a quick worker but he doesn't understand 
                the pressure of operating a business in a high rent location like this one, a bit arrogant. I have to watch him closely until I feel confident he's 
                representing the cafe well, then I hope the current staff arrangement will get up to speed 
                and I can relax and take a back seat in the management.
                <br><br>
                I've been having problems with the supervisor talking back to me and had been thinking about finding someone else. When I dropped in to the cafe for a scheduled
                meeting with them to get them in line Stanley said he wanted to speak to us both. He proceeded to talk angrily about how he didn't like something about the way 
                we were communicating.
                <br><br>
                I was shocked. At first I told him he better stand down if he wants to keep his job, but the way he was speaking I knew he had to go. I didn't realise he was so 
                ungrateful and rude, I have put a lot of time into training him but I can't tolerate that kind of disrespect, he has to go immediately. 
              </i>
            </p></li>
          </ol>
          <p>
            Interesting. This still gets me annoyed and leaves a bad taste, I'm a bit embarassed by how I handled it, going through this exercise 
            feels like it shines an interesting light on the blind spots on either side, at the time I didn't understand 
            the owners position or what was driving their behaviour. I might have kept a cool head if I'd taken the time to more 
            actively put myself in their shoes.
            <br><br>
            Was I within my rights protesting the situation? Was I being unreasonable? Still don't know. Being able to handle a situation like this in a way that empathised with everyone involved would be so satisfying.
          </p>
          <h2>Other Musings</h2>
          <p>
            Here are some things that this part of the book sounded off in my mind.
            <br><br>
          </p>
          <ol>
            <li><p>
              The intention behind listening and connecting is extremely important. I think a persons intention behind deeply understanding and empathising with someone 
              is a different thing than their <em>ability</em> to understand and empathise. In my limited experience it always seems 
              that better understanding leads to more caring intentions and vice versa, which is a pretty cool thing.
              <br><br>
              There are so many reasons for people attempting to understand each others internal worlds and form a bridge, I don't think
              there's ever one operating at a time, they blur together and form a motive soup. Knowing this maybe it's at least as important to 
              ask "what are my/your motives here?" as it is to ask "how do we understand and connect to each other better".
            </p></li>
            <li><p>
              I like the '3 assumptions' which to me boil down to 'assume people are basically good and reasonable at their core'. Very powerful and very simple
            </p></li>
            <li><p>
              I think that as a person expands their ability to understand others they have a greater 
              responsibility to respect other's privacy.
              <br><br>
              In general I think people want to be understood, and they also want to have a say in how and when they reveal parts of themselves to others, 
              if you have a keen sense of observation and empathy might you sometimes find yourself seeing further inside someone than they are ready to reveal?
              Not sure, interesting
