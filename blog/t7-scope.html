          <p>
            Throughout a given section of javascript there will be variables being created and referred to. One thing we need to know is 
            <i>what variables are visible from a given location in the code?</i> To answer this question we need to understand scope.
            <br><br>
            Here's some code: 
          </p>
          <pre><code>
            var i = 'some value'
            function func() {
              var x = 'some other value
              console.log(i,x);
            }
            console.log(i,x);
          </code></pre>
          <p>
            This code can be broken down into sections (called scopes). The outermost section that contains everything is called the 'global scope'.
            <br><em>Variables defined in the global scope are visible everywhere in the code</em>.
            <br><br>
            In javascript each function creates a new scope inside it's curly braces, this creates a pattern of scopes inside scopes which looks 
            a lot like the boxifying diagrams from a few sprints ago. Since we can have functions inside functions inside functions, in a given portion of code,
            we get a nested structure of scopes.
          </p>
          <img src="../images/basic-scope.png" alt="diagram of scope relationship">
          <p>
            Running the code above we get one error, the second console.log statement doesn't know what x is. This is because
            <em>variables are not visible outside their scope, but they are visible to all 'child' scopes inside of the scope where they 
              are defined.
            </em>
            <br><br>
            This is why 'x' can see 'i' but not the other way around.
          </p>
          <h2>Closures</h2>
          <p>
            When a function is created, it keeps a complete set of references to the variables visible to it <i>at the time of creation</i>.
            This set of variables is called the <i>closure</i> and allows for some nifty tricks.
            <br><br>
            Here's an example to illustrate:
          </p>
          <pre><code>
            var statement = 'original statement';

            function makeFlexiblePrinter() {
              return function() {
                console.log(statement);
              }
            }

            function makeFixedPrinter() {
              // we copy our statement to a local variable
              let secretCopy = statement; 
              return function() {
                console.log(secretCopy);
              }
            }

            var fixedPrinter = makeFixedPrinter(),
                flexiblePrinter = makeFlexiblePrinter();
            statement = 'new statement';
            fixedPrinter(); // outputs 'original statement';
            flexiblePrinter(); //outputs 'new statement';
          </code></pre>
          <p>
            The two 'printer maker' functions in this code both return functions that are going to return some kind of statement. 
            What happens to the 'localCopy' variable? Even though this variable should dissapear along with it's parent function it lives on even after
            we change the original statement variable.
            <br><br>
            This is because when we create the fixed printer the variable 'localCopy' is visible, as well as the 'statement' variable, 
            so a reference pointing to each of these get included in the closure. This means the printer can see both the copy of original 
            statement and the current statement after changes, it has a secret variable in it's closure.
            <br><br>
            In contrast at the time we are making the flexible printer the only visible variable is 'statement' so when a change is made this 
            printer has no memory of the original statement.
