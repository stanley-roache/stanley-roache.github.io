          <h2>Getting Blocked</h2>
          <p>
            I got quite blocked during the design process in Sprint 3. I was in the process of coming up with a new design for 
            this website starting from base intention questions. I think in this case the issue was in two parts:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>I felt like I had to get everything right and perfect the first time</li>
            <li>
              I was fixating on the end result, not giving my full attention to each step along the way and breaking the process into 
              manageable steps.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Looking ahead the task felt vague and unachievable. It was a bit stressful and unpleasant at first. My automatic response was something like 
            "there's no time for this, I better force it until something gives to keep it moving". Obviously that's not so true or helpful, but it 
            took a bit of effort to see that I was thinking that way and to change my approach.
            <br><br>
            The way I did it was first to stop trying to get immediate results and get some distance from the task at hand. Then I asked myself OK what am 
            I actually trying to do here? I also voiced the issue I was having in one of the video checkins and got a few perspectives from 
            others looking back at that sprint and some currently going through it.
            <br><br>
            Doing this gave me the space to see what I was expecting and how I was attempting to solve the problem through mental force.
            I came at it again with the intention of including just one or two features I knew I wanted 
            and going through the design process step by step based around those aspects. This felt much more accessable and enjoyable.
          </p>
          <h2>An Elegant Solution</h2>
          <p>
            I found a puzzle on free code camp which was very satisfying to solve - building a function that converts numbers into roman numerals.
            <br><br>
            I think I relied heavily on pseudocoding here - to get a solution I had to break down the process into smaller and smaller steps
             until I could see a way to translate each step into code. There was no real getting stuck as such, just the process 
            of taking a task that I could understand, making it general so it worked everytime, and breaking it down into pieces that I could code with.
          </p>
          <h2>Confidence in Techniques</h2>
          <p>
            I have a basic tendency to not acknowledge I'm stuck and try and put in a bit more raw effort in the hopes 
            that the problem will just dissolve, doesn't work often! But once I do take a step back most of the 
            techniques feel pretty natural.
            <br><br>
            The more attached I feel to the outcome, the harder it can be to take that first step back when I hit a wall.
            <br><br>
            Asking for help from peers or mentors can sometimes take a bit more, it very much depends on how willing 
            I am to admit that I can't figure something the problem out, if I'm in a state of wanting 
            to prove myself, how much trust I have that people are willing to help etc.
            Actually this is often difficult, I'd like to be able to more freely ask for help.
            <br><br>
            I think reflecting is a skill that I don't have good habits in using, I'd like to do this as part of my day more often, 
            when I overcome something, have some strong experience or get stuck.
            <br><br>
            I'm looking forward to encountering more problems that require me to call on all of this.
