          <h2>Time Techniques</h2>
          <p>
            I experimented with a couple of techniques and ideas around time.
            <br><br>
            I found <em>timeboxing</em> especially powerful and simple, it felt easy using this technique to have a focused jam on something,
            stop to evaluate my position and then commit to another focus. I can alternately lose focus or get lost in details and this
            seems a good tool to manage both.
            <br><br>
            Pomidoro felt like a similar, more specific version of this. Also a good way to maintain mental freshness, I'm going to play more with it.
            <br><br>
            Another thing that stood out was the value of finding your own natural rhythm and riding off that, not
            using tricks to force work into conventional patterns.
            <br><br>
            This appeals to me a lot, I know I can work in a variety of different ways, but I feel at my peak when I rise early, have a period
            of activity and thought, then basically a siesta, a long break in the early afternoon and another period of activity through the evening.
            This is a challenge to fit in with modern work structure, for example I can't work like this during the bootcamp. But it will be interesting
            to see if I can adapt my working routine to partially fit that.<br><br>
            Playing with these techniques it is clear to me that I currently don't have much awareness of how I spend my time!
            It'll be an interesting experience to expand this and I feel once I'm more aware of how long different things take, how much 
            time I really have etc. I will be in a much better position to structure my time in advance or 
            commit to things that fill my time but don't overstretch.
          </p>
          <h2>Clarity of Intention</h2>
          <p>
            Some of the resources also discussed how to get in the zone, how to be productive and identify what 
            is important.<br><br>
            This clicked and <em>I realised intention and reason play a big part for me.</em><br><br>
            Sometimes I found myself setting aside the time and then struggling to get into something.
            Usually it comes down to not being clear about how this task is relevant to something important to me.
            Basically, why does this matter again?
            Once I refresh my picture of how what I have set myself contributes to something I value,
            my desire and energy return.<br><br>
            Often asking these questions is surprising, I might initially feel like something is urgent and be pushing myself to engage but not getting it,
            I'll stop and try and picture exactly how this fits into what I'm aiming at and I can't, it's actually a bit irrelevant. 

            It's a challenge but also massively rewarding to catch myself at these times 
            and free my attention for something else.

          <h2>Divorcing measures of work from self-worth</h2>
          <p>
            One of the sources had <a href="http://paidtoexist.com/counterintuitive-productivity/">seven counterintuitive tricks</a> for getting into work flow,
            one of which contained the point:
          </p>            

          <blockquote><i>Stop measuring your self-worth (how much you get done) based on how much time you put in. 
          First, divorce your self-worth from your productivity. You are worthy no matter what...</i></blockquote>

          <p>
            Gold! For me it is important to remember this as I can connect my self-worth to my productivity or ability 
            and that means when I come to do the work and learning, I'm not only doing it for what it gives me or others, I'm doing
            it partially just to feel worthwhile.<br><br>
            I feel this is an easy and silent trap to fall into, and it does in the short term unleash a huge amount of energy. If there's a 
            task to do that's not so interesting maybe it's hard to engage in, if there's something to do that makes you feel like you're worth
            more as a person, it can induce more motivation. This has happened to me without me realising at all in the past. The costs, which are questioning
            my own worth or risking getting stuck into things that don't actually matter just to prove something, are never worth it.
            <br><br>
            This feels an important thing to remember and similar to a point made in the fireside video. The modern educational system
            is a force that can condition people to become passive in their learning process, in the same way I believe many
            aspects of our current social systems can condition people to not believe in their fundamental self-worth but hold their own worth
            as conditional on things like productivity, talent, etc.<br><br>
            For me it's a priority to maintain a supersolid core of self-worth (and the fundamental worth of others) while extending and challenging myself, this is something that takes a bit of deliberation.

            <li><p>Further timeboxing</p></li>
            <li><p>Clarifying questions: how is what I am doing to connected to something that is of value to me? Why am I doing this?</p></li>
            <li><p>Experiment to find my core rhythms and see how much I can adapt my work to them</p></li>
            <li><p>When I get into periods of intense focus and engagement, make note of what the context was, what set me up for it. How can I make it happen again</p></li>
            <li><p>When and how to best take breaks</p></li>
            <li><p>How do I best maintain the seperation between self-worth and measures of progress while challenging myself</p></li>
