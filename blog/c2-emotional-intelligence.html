          <h2>Learnings from Chapter One</h2>
          <h3>Baseline Experience vs Transitory Experiences</h3>
          <p>
            I enjoyed the point that people generally assume the baseline of emotional experience as fixed, whereas actually
            it is highly flexible and depends on deliberate actions and mental habits. This feels like such a great thing! I definitely
            often live on the assumption the baseline is out of my control and look for stimulatory experiences to take me above my that level.
          </p>
          <h3>Accessibility through Language</h3>
          <p>
            I liked the language used a lot. I definitely found it made the concepts and practice of mindfulness more relatable.
            I sometimes find that I shut my mind to something if language used feels vague to me, alluding but not actually refering to 
            something relatable, probably just because I have a limited experience to relate from.
          </p>

              emotions.	 High-resolution	 perception	 means	 your	 perception	 becomes	 so	 refined	 across	 both	 time	 and
              space	that	you	can	watch	an	emotion	the	moment	it	is	arising,	you	can	perceive	its	subtle	changes	as	it
              waxes	and	wanes,	and	you	can	watch	it	the	moment	it	ceases.
            </i></blockquote>
          <p> 
            With this kind of language it all seems much more approachable.
          </p>
          <h3>Felt Experience</h3>
          <p>
            It's continually amazing to me that emotion, intuition, perceptual awareness are often mainly experienced through body sensations.
            Not through rational inspection, or mind states, but through felt sensation. Just, awesome, we are such complex and capable creatures. 
            I guess it makes sense, but it's not the way I grew up thinking.
          </p>
          <h3>Deliberate Relaxation</h3>
          <p>
            I like the idea that calmness under pressure is a trainable skill, at the moment I can find it easy to have a high level
            of stress that doesn't feel useful. I really aspire to that kind of well-held inner calm and would like to practice it.
          </p>
          <h3>Something Old and Natural</h3>
          <p>
            I like the reminders in the book that it's not all that complicated ('embarassingly simple'), but just takes effort.
            As far as I can tell these practices, developing and focusing attention, self-awareness and mastery, are as old as people and as natural
            as eating or learning to walk and talk. It's just that today we're out of touch with a lot of innate human capacities so when then reappear 
            in dialogue and common experience they can seem new. 
          </p>
          <h3>Empathy</h3>
          <p>
            I think I'm ok at focused listening and understanding the situation and perspective of other people, I also can definitely go for long
            periods where I ignore and lose that connection or get socially anxious and shut down a bit, I reckon I'd enjoy and get a lot from 
            developing this.
          </p>
      
          <h2>Two Minutes of Mindfulness</h2>
          <p>
            I really enjoyed this. I felt able to calm down and focus a surprising amount. 2 minutes intially felt too short but actually when I did it
            it was very accessible.
