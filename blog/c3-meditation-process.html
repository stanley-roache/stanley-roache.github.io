          <h2>Process over Product</h2>
          <p>
            This approach was both pretty difficult for me to get into and also liberating when I did.
            <br><br>
            As an example when I was going through the redesign process for the website based on the skeleton framework,
            I found myself gravitating around a certain look before I'd properly thought about the intention of my site.
            <ul>
              <li>Who is my target audience?</li>
              <li>What is the purpose of the site?</li>
            </ul>
            I like the idea of stripping back all assumptions of how the end product should be and starting from the very basic questions, building
            up from there. In this case I did answer these questions but I kind of already had an image of how I wanted my site to 
            look and behave, who knows, maybe letting this go and really focusing on those starting points of intention would have
            unlocked a more creative approach.
            <br><br>
            Remembering to engage in the process and let the product emerge definitely helped me to overcome
            getting stuck in details and perfection. I would remind myself that going through the redesign process I could trust
            that I'd get somewhere I liked even if it didn't fit some ideal and also that this was <em>just the first iteration</em>. I'd be looking at how my site
            appeared after a stint, coming up with new ideas and reworking it again and again.

          <h2>Chapter Two: <em>Breathe as if your life depended on it</em></h2>

          <h3>Past Practice - Strain and Loss</h3>
          <p>
            I've had some experience of regular meditation and profound positive effects coming from it a couple of years ago. After a while I pushed
            it a bit hard and viewed it as a tool for self improvement, eventually I just couldn't very easily sit in meditation anymore, especially
            alone, without getting more and more tense and unhappy.
            <br><br>
            I like the analogy of a a person riding a horse in chapter one where horse and rider are different parts of a person. I'll stretch that and say that when I was meditating regularly I felt
            as though I was riding a strong horse somewhere and it was a massive joy, I don't know exactly what part of me the horse was... 
            Then I got impatient and began to whip the horse to go faster and not really respect it. It tolerated it for a while but 
            eventually bucked me off and left. I guess my attitude became very toxic, meditation was just another tool for self-improvement 
            and I was never good enough. This attitudinal part is the hardest part for me.
            <br><br>
            So reading about meditation and trying it out again is a little difficult. It has been rough to have and then lose that experience of enhaced state of self and regular practice, and now
            I'm unsure of my ability to get back on. 
            <br><br>
            It's exciting to think I might be able to continue with that again. It would be great to approach mindfulness practice
            in a way that feels good and respectful and patient, I think doing it slowly and alongside 
            other people would have a big impact in maintaining a good attitude.
          </p>
          
          <!-- <h3>What did you think about meditation before reading chapter two</h3>
          <p>
            I think I mentioned the last post, I've had some experience with meditation before so I had some thoughts already.
            This one was a really interesting one for me.
            On the one hand meditation offers a way to access peace and calm and acceptance no matter what the external situation, this is something I highly value.
            It also offers increased focus, happiness, 
            <br><br>
            No matter what I do, what anyone does, we could at any point be more focused, be more tolerant, have a greater positive impact in the world, be kinder to ourselves,
            have a healthier mind and body, achieve more, have better connections with people. There is never a maximum. There is always that 'more' that we miss out on.
            Knowing that, how do I engage in self-cultivation and self-acceptance at the same time? When I will never be all that I can be?
            I wrestle with a lot, I'd like to be accepting of myself, others and the world in their various states, but in the face of so much possible improvement
            I feel like I am never enough, basically.
            <br><br>
            Meditation shows this paradox up in a sharp light exactly because it has so many positive effects, because it is such a powerful tool,
            because I've had such a positive experience with it in the past.
            I think if I'm to reengage at all again in the practice and enjoy the process I have to find a reliable way to get out of that
            mindset. At the moment I just think 'oh fuck not again, when can I just enjoy my life and forget improvement' The strain of being very aware 
            there is more that I could be that I am not now. To be ignorant of the potential often feels easier, kinder.
