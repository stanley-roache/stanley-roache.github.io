          <h2>Process over Product</h2>
          <p>
            This approach was pretty difficult for me to get into and also liberating when I did.
            <br><br>
            As an example when I was going through the redesign process for the website based on the skeleton framework,
            I found myself gravitating around a certain look before I'd properly thought about the intention of my site.
            <ul>
              <li>Who is my target audience?</li>
              <li>What is the purpose of the site?</li>
            </ul>
            I like the idea of stripping back all assumptions of how the end product should be and starting from the very basic questions, building
            up from there. In this case I did answer these questions but I kind of already had an image of how I wanted my site to 
            look and behave, who knows, maybe letting this go and really focusing on those starting points of intention would have
            unlocked a more creative approach.
            <br><br>
            Remembering to engage in the process and let the product emerge definitely helped me to overcome
            getting stuck in details and perfection. I would remind myself that going through the redesign process I could trust
            that I'd get somewhere I liked even if it didn't fit some ideal and also that this was <em>just the first iteration</em>. I'd be looking at how my site
            appeared after a stint, coming up with new ideas and reworking it again and again.
          </p>

          <h2>Chapter Two: "Breathe as if your life depended on it"</h2>

          <p>
            I'm going to deviate from the suggested questions here. I guess none of what I am reading is conceptually new or unfamiliar to me, 
            it is more a different framing and perspective which  I am getting a lot from.
          </p>

          <h3>Past Practice - Forcing and Loss</h3>
          <p>
            I've had some experience of regular meditation and profound positive effects coming from it a couple of years ago. After a while I pushed
            it a bit hard and viewed it as a tool for self improvement, eventually I just couldn't very easily sit in meditation anymore, especially
            alone, without getting more and more tense and unhappy.
            <br><br>
            I like the analogy of a a person riding a horse in chapter one where horse and rider are different parts of a person. It was as though with meditation 
            I had no respect for my horse, always whipping it to go faster until eventually it kicked me off (fair enough). I guess my attitude became very toxic, 
            it was just another tool for betterment and I was never good enough to take it easy and appreciate things. This attitudinal part is the hardest part for me.
            <br><br>
            So reading about meditation and trying it out again is a little difficult. It has been rough to have and then lose that experience of enhaced state of self and regular practice,
            I'm unsure of my ability to get back on. 
            <br><br>
            It's exciting to think I might be able to continue again. It would be great to approach mindfulness practice
            in a way that feels good and respectful and patient, I think doing it slowly and alongside 
            other people would have a big impact in maintaining a good attitude.
            <br><br>
            I find it very ironic that I managed to make meditation, which is supposed to an act of allowing everything to be as it is, into 
            a very stressful and forceful act for myself. If it can be done then it can be undone!
          </p>
          
          <h3>Second meditation experiment - 20min</h3>
          <p>
            This was great! I set myself a goal of 20min and to be honest I was expecting to get wound up in tension like I 
            have the last few times I sat down and tried to focus on my breathe. I was surprised how calm and focused a state of mind I could get into.
            There was no mental forcing.
            <br><br>
            Perhaps reading SIY and having a good retrospect about what has tripped me up previously is allowing me to rengage with a more helpful mindset. 
            I hope this is the case and I look forward to incorporating it into my day again.
          </p>
          
          <h3>Techniques I like</h3>
          <p>
            I really enjoy the 'easy' technique suggested by Meng. Using the breath as an attention anchor. It's easier for me to tell where my attention
            is this way when I do drift. I'm going to see how I go doing a short breathe focused meditation some mornings. I'm guessing that at some point 
            I will get on the tension/forceful wind-up train during meditation as I get back into it, I'll have to be on watch for that and remember not to force anything, 
            step back and maintain a gentle attitude.
