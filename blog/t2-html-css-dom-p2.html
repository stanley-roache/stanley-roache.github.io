          <h2>Grid-Based Design</h2>
          <p>
            HTML starts off arranging itself line by line, it's simple with just html to arrange elements vertically
            in the way you'd like. Grid-based design involves splitting the webpage into columns and rows, this allows
            content to sit side by side.
            <br><br>
            This can be done in a simple way by predefining a row class and column classes set at useful widths, each
            row class uses flex box to fit the columns nicely side by side and a set of columns is chosen such that together they
            take up the exact full width of the row-container they sit in. Any group of elements can be made to fit into the grid 
            by adding one of the column classes to it's HTML tag
          </p>
          <h2>Responsive Design</h2>
          <p>
            A webpage designed for a computer screen might not be that friendly on a phone screen, and vice versa. Responsive
            design is the practice of making webpages that adjust to the specific screen and device they are being viewed on
            so that the user experience is consistent/smooth across all devices.

          <h2>Semantic Structure of HTML</h2>
          <p>
            While translating a design into HTML a first step is to split the page into rectangular portions,
            in a grid layout or some other format. The next is to choose which elements are of the same type, which ones
            are the most important etc. and set appropriate HTML tags. This allows for easy management, easy to read code 
            and simple CSS access. This choice of types of HTML tag is the semantic structure. 
          </p>
          <h2>Responsiveness without Scripting</h2>
          <p>
            I'm finding it interesting and user friendly that so much interactiveness and responsiveness is available with just HTML and CSS. 
            I had expected the task of querying the device size and view window size to be part of the javascript.
