          <h2>When programming, what are some of your triggers?</h2>
          <p>
            Something that often triggers me is hearing about or observing other peoples awesome work. Earlier last week I was perusing some blogs of fellow phase0-ers, 
            seeing some good looking blogs were was a bit of a trigger, I got a similar reaction reading about Mingyurs experience in chapter of Search Inside Yourself.
          </p>  
          <blockquote>
            Mingyur	Rinpoche	provides	a	powerful	personal	example	of	befriending	emotions.	He	suffered	from
            full-blown	panic	disorder	until	the	age	of	thirteen.	When	he	was	thirteen	and	in	the	middle	of	a	meditation
            retreat,	Mingyur	decided	to	look	deep	into	his	panic. He	realized	there	are	two	ways	to... ...In	just	three	days,	his	panic	went	away,	permanently.

            Basically, sometimes I carry a belief that I need to be impressive or outstanding somehow in order to be worth my own attention 
            and the attention of others. When I hear of someone elses success, challenge overcome, display of skill etc. from this perspective it can be threatening or demoralising, because so much seems to depend on my relative standing 
            to others. This is a familiar bind, the SBNRR exercise was a pretty cool way to recognise and respond to it.

            Super illuminating. It had a strong effect both in putting the brakes on the initial out of control feeling of 
            being triggered and strong emotion and later in gaining perspective and insight into the source of it. I liked that Meng mentioned these two separate 
            aspects, dealing with the intial recoil and regaining balance on the one hand, and on the other delving into the source and creating a 
            positive response or new persepctive out of it.
            <br><br>
            While I was going through the steps, especially notice and reflect, I sometimes had the sense of being two people, one reacting to the situation and kind of stuck in a view that made that trigger 
            a recurring thing in my life, disbelieving there was another way to see things. The other watching as though I was someone else and aware of all the other possible ways 
            to see my situation. I guess that is the idea, it felt quite strange, but good, I could feel care 
            and desire to resolve the situation going from one to the other.
            <br><br>
            I think with processes like this a lot depends on how much a person is willing and able to deeply engage, 
            in this case I felt able to do that and had a powerful response, other times I might go through the motions but actually not be doing it sincerely and not 
            get such a result.
