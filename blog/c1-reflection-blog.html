    <h2>What's your take on the DBC/EDA attitude?</h2>
    <p>
        The thing that stands out to me most from the video is the mentioned 
        difference between a passive consumer attitude and a cocreater attitude (in learning in this case but I feel it 
        applies everywhere in life).
    </p>
    <p>
        From what I've read and seen so far the EDA attitude also heavily emphasises social and soft skills alongside technical skills.
        Principles of Integrity, Kindness and Effort - and others mentioned in the video, beginner's mind, self-belief etc. are given the highest priority over 
        the mastery of specific techniques.
    </p>

    <h2>What are you're impressions?</h2>
    <p>I like this attitude set because it continually opens the door, anyone can engage and any skill can be approached
        in a powerful and enjoyable way. </p>

    <p>
        I definitely feel that in my educational experience I have been conditioned to adopt
        a consumer attitude and give up my responsibility and creativity in the learning process. Also to some degree to value 
        competition over cooperation.
        It's great to have a chance to dive into a creative engagement and cooperation and see how much I can get and give.
    </p>

    <p>
        Questions I have are: 
        <ul>
            <li>How best can I cultivate an active and creative role in my learning and life in general?</li>
            <li>How do I support others in this?</li>
        </ul>
    </p>

    <p>I appreciated that common fears/apprehensions of students were noted and welcomed.
            I don't strongly experience the fears mentioned, being either far behind or far ahead of 
            the ability of the cohort. I expect the bootcamp to be highly challenging and also trust that whatever the different capacities within the group
            that everyone will find a way to enhance each other's learning without needing to be at exactly the same place.</p>
            
        
            <p>My own fears are largely social ones:
                <ol>
                    <li>That I might behave in an arrogant or inconsiderate way. What if in the face of 
                        so much unfamiliar territory I start doing things to try and look clever and interfere with a good connection and learning environment.
                    </li>
                    <li>I will offend someone or make some kind of faux pas and miss out on or just not understand some feedback 
                        and the chance to reform my behaviour. I think I have this fear because I respect the cultural principles and 
                        they also seem like they will stretch me.
                    </li>
                </ol>
            </p>

            <p>Bit squeamish putting that here! But seems important to acknowledge. And with awareness
                easy to manage.
            </p>
    
   

    <h2>How do you see yourself engaging with this type of culture?</h2>
    <p>I think it will be an adjustment and challenging at times, like picking up a whole lot of habits at once. It will require being open and clear with others, 
        going through stress with others. As I mentioned, the apprehensions I have are mainly about
        how I will fit in with the group. Having said that once I'm in the midst I feel I will be able to really absorb and partake
        in the culture and will really enjoy it.
    </p>
    
    <h2>Have your expectations of EDA changed? If so, how?</h2>
    <p>Not so much changed as clarified. Especially the call to a high level of
    engagement, ownership and cooperation with others.
    </p>

    <h2>Am I excited and/or nervous?</h2>
    <p>Yes for sure. I am excited to be engaged in a program and community in which so many things that I hope to practice are actively cultivated.
        Also nervous, in the way that strong responsibility makes me. When I get out, what I have gained will depend mainly on choices and actions I have taken
        rather than on the exact material of the course. It's up to me to push my learning capacity, open myself to others and engage fully. 
        That's thrilling and also weighty.</p>
