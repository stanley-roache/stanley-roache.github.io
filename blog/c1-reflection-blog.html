          <h3>What's your take on the DBC/EDA attitude?</h3>
          <p>
            The thing that stands out to me most from the video is the mentioned 
            difference between a passive consumer attitude and a cocreater attitude (in learning in this case but I feel it 
            applies pretty broadly).
            <br><br>
            From what I've read and seen so far the EDA attitude heavily emphasises social and soft skills alongside technical skills.
            Principles of Integrity, Kindness and Effort - and others mentioned in the video, beginner's mind, self-belief, self-care etc. are given the highest priority over 
            the mastery of specific techniques.
          </p>
          <h3>What are your impressions?</h3>
          <p>
            I like this attitude set because it continually opens the door, anyone can engage and any skill can be approached
            in a powerful and enjoyable way. <br><br>

            It also puts positive relationships, to self/others/work material before relative capacity which 
            to me is a good way of doing things. <br><br> 

            I'd definitely say that in my educational experience I have been conditioned to adopt
            a consumer attitude and give up chunks of my responsibility and creativity in the learning process. Also to some degree to value 
            competition over cooperation. It's great to have a chance to engage in intense learning where that culture is flipped.
            <br><br>
            Questions I have are:
          </p> 
          <ul>
            <li><p>How do I cultivate an active and creative role in my learning and life in general?</p></li>
            <li><p>How do I support others in this?</p></li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            I appreciated that common fears/apprehensions of students were noted and welcomed.
            I don't strongly experience the fears mentioned, being either far behind or far ahead of 
            the ability of the cohort. I expect the bootcamp to be highly challenging and also trust that whatever the different capacities within the group
            that everyone will find a way to enhance each other's learning without needing to be at exactly the same place.
            <br><br>
            My own fears are largely social ones:
          </p>
          <ol>
            <li>
              <p>
                  That I might behave in an arrogant or inconsiderate way. What if in the face of 
                  unfamiliar territory I start doing things to try and look clever and interfere with a good connection and learning environment.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                I will offend someone or make some kind of faux pas and miss out on or just not understand some feedback 
                and the chance to reform my behaviour. I think I have this fear because I respect the cultural principles and 
                they also seem like they will stretch me.
              </p>
            </li>
          </ol>
          <p>
            Those both make a bit of sense and feel managable with awareness
          </p>
            
          <h3>How do you see yourself engaging with this type of culture?</h3>
          <p>
            I think I'll really enjoy it and be able to contribute. I expect it will be an adjustment and challenging at times, like picking up a whole lot of habits at once. It will require being open and clear with others, 
            going through stress with others. As I mentioned, the apprehensions I have are mainly about
            how I will fit in with the group. But once I'm in the midst I know I'll be able to absorb and partake
            in the culture well.
          </p>
            
          <h3>Have your expectations of EDA changed? If so, how?</h3>
          <p>
            Not so much changed as clarified. Especially the call to a high level of
            engagement, ownership and cooperation with others. <br><br>
            This is also a strong reminder that there's no ceiling involved, there's going to be much more material than is possible to totally master,
            good to remember to let go of grasping everything at once and just take in as much as I can.
          </p>

          <h3>Am I excited and/or nervous?</h3>
          <p>
            Yes for sure. Both
