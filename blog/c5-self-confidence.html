          <h2>What is the relationship between mindfulness and self-awareness</h2>
          <p>
            Mindfulness over time leads to self-awareness. 
            <br><br>
            Mindfulness is the act or attitude of paying attention in a certain way. 
            Self-awareness is a combination of experience, self-knowledge and the ability to 
            recognise things inside yourself and percieve them in detail. Your tendencies, your current state, likes, strengths, relationships etc.
          </p>
          <h2>Body Scan</h2>
          <p>
            This is another practice that I have a little bit of experience with and haven't done much recently. 
            I've been really enjoying a return to meditation alongside reading this book so I'm curious and looking forward to 
            how the body scan goes.
            <br><br>
            As I go through my body there are some areas that are tense or tight or out of balance, usually my lower back,
            IT band and knees. When I put my attention in these areas and start to feel them directly I get a huge amount of frustration and sometimes 
            disgust at my body state. It's kind of alarming how strong it is. The physical sensations themselves are quite mild but I start to tense up 
            or cringe at it.
            <br><br>
            This happened when I tried the body scan and got to my back, I decided I'd just keep my focus there and see the two feelings as separate, on the one hand the physical 
            sensation in my back, and on the other the built up frustration and listen to them or watch them for a while. After a while the frustration started 
            to dissapate a little bit and I could relax and feel inside my back more than I normally can.
            <br><br>
            This was a really helpful thing to realise, I think it is a common pattern I have. Some area in my life is neglected, out 
            of balance or not the way I'd like it. If my first attempts to deal with it don't work or I feel like the situation is beyond my ability
            I can quickly get a high level of frustration. That intensity of frustration is something in itself that I tend to avoid or feel unequipped to handle. 
            So I never get to actually enter the core area and attend to it. I'm sure this can change.
            <br><br>
            Afterwards I felt extremely relaxed. Going to do this again.
          </p>
          <h2>My emotions are not me section</h2>
          <p>
            What I took from this was that while emotions influence a person and affect decision making and actions, they way they percieve things etc,
            the person is never totally controlled or defined by the emotion, they always have a variety of responses to choose from. It's a little bit like outer landscape - whatever position a 
            person finds themselves in, that position in a real sense limits and defines the possible actions they can take. If you are on a boat in a storm or if you are in the middle of grief you have 
            different options and experiences available than in your own home or in a calm emotional state. And at the same time a person is totally free to respond to their internal and external situatuion in the way they choose.
            The core remains stable throughout it.
            <br><br>
            Another thing I took was that the ability to experience emotions fully and expand your sense of what is possible 
            while carrying that emotional state are things that can both grow with practice. Pretty liberating to think about, that it's possible to 
            feel life more and more deeply and at the same time be more and more free in how you choose to live, more balanced throughout intense situations.
            <br><br>
            I can't quite get on board with emotions being purely body-based experiences.. I definitely experience emotions in my mind and perception 
            too. Say in times of anger, I can feel it in my body and also in the way I start seeing things. My mind is cold and direct, things that 
            usually seem important now seem irrelevant, all worries go away. I would say those aspects exist independent of my body.
            <br><br>
            I would take a different angle and say body sensation is maybe the easiest and most sensitive way to <em>recognise</em> emotional current that might otherwise 
            go on unconsciously or in hazy detail, rather than saying that emotions are experienced only or predominantly in the body.
          </p>
          <h2>Enjoyment</h2>
          <p>
            I'm getting a lot out of reading this book, practising, and reflecting each week. I've been a bit stuck in thinking that since I already had read of these 
            concepts and understood them in my mind that they should be easy to me in practice. But actually I had put myself in a rut thinking this way, I still need and gain a lot from support and taking instructions.
            Good and humbling to come down from that.
            <br><br>
            I think the next missing piece for getting back into 'it' is a greater connection to others experiences and search for more meaning or self-awareness. I look forward to 
            some of that during the bootcamp.
