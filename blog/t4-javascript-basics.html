          <h2>How does Javascript compare to HTML and CSS?</h2>
          <p>
            HTML and CSS for the most part are very static, they decide the layout and appearance of a site but very little about what the site does.
            What happens when you push buttons? Where does the information go when you fill out a form? What if you need the site
            to do something for you when you ask it.
            <br><br>
            Javascript is a language that controls almost all of these active aspects of the site and is very different code to look at.
            It's like the nervous system of your body. All the thinking happens there and it's the source of all action on your website.
          </p>
          <h2>Control Flow</h2>
          <p>
            Everytime a piece of javascript code get's run (executed) in the browser, the browser is running one instruction at a time.
            Most of the time this just means the lines of code are executed in order.
            <br><br>
            With loops and functions it is possible to repeat some code until a certain condition is achieved, or jump to another section of code 
            entirely, do what it says there, then jump back. The flow of control is the order or pattern in which the lines of code are run. 
            Let's use waking up and eating breakfast as an example, maybe a morning looks like this:
          </p>
          <ol>
            <li>Wake up.</li>
            <li>Get up and stretch.</li>
            <li>Repeat this until not hungry:
              <ol>
                <li>Put piece of bread in toaster.</li>
                <li>Spread butter and marmite on toast.</li>
                <li>Eat toast</li>
              </ol>
            </li>
            <li>Do the brushing teeth routine.</li>
            <li>Is it a weekday? If yes, get ready for work. Otherwise read a book.</li>
            <li>Brushing teeth routine:
              <ol>
                <li>Put toothpaste on toothbrush</li>
                <li>Brush teeth</li>
                <li>Rinse mouth with water</li>
                <li>Go back to what you were doing before</li>
              </ol>
            </li>
          </ol>
          <p>
            If we start at the top and follow the instructions, clearly they aren't all going to happen in the order they're written. 
            At 3. eating breakfast the flow of control goes into a <em>loop</em> until a condition (hunger) is satisfied.
            Later the flow of control jumps from breakfast to the teeth brushing routine and back to where it left off, in real application a section of code 
            like this is called a <em>function</em>, when a function is called all the instructions inside it get run. Later on 
            we get a point in the code that looks like it's going to branch into two options, weekday or weekend. So these 
            are some ways that real flow of control in code might work.
          </p>
          <h2>Arrays and Objects</h2>
          <p>
            These are both ways to store a collection of data. An array is a set of items in a specific order, you refer to an item (element) in the 
            array by its <em>index</em>. The index is the position of the item in the array starting at 0 so if you want the 20th item in an array you ask for <code>array[19]</code>. If you
            want the first item - <code>array[0]</code>.
            <br><br>
            Data inside objects are stored with labels, so when you access an item you ask for it by it's label. You might want to know the number 
            of seats stored in the object 'car', you'd refer to it with: <code>car.numberOfSeats</code>
          </p>
          <h2>Functions</h2>
          <p>
            A function is a collection of code with it's own name that can be <em>called</em> - requested from somewhere else in the script. Functions can take input values or objects
            and can also return values. For example you might be writing some code in which you frequently need to find the greatest number in a list of numbers. 
            You could write a function <code>findGreatestNumber(list) {code that does the job}</code>. Now that it's written you can ask for this to happen from anywhere
            in the script.
