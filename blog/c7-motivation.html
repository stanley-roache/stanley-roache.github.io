          <h2>Pleasure, Passion and Purpose</h2>
          <p>
            I like this lense on life and where enjoyment comes from, it is reassuring in a way. I can relate to times when a high level of 
            passion and engagement made discomfort or lack of instantaneous pleasure not only more tolerable, but kind of an enhancement 
            to the enjoyment of something. And I can see myself searching for momentary pleasure when I am lacking the longer term fulfillment of 
            passion and purpose.
            <br><br>
            I don't believe I know what it's like to live with a strong and stable purpose, it's something that I'd 
            really like to have.
          </p>
          <h2>What are your core values? What do you stand for?</h2>
          <p>
            This was pretty fun and surprising to answer. I tend to think of myself as someone who is considerate to others, frequently going out of 
            my way to offer something. But when I asked myself what my core values were and wrote them down they were kind of self-concerned.
            <br><br>
            I value authenticity particularly when it isn't convenient or requires sacrifice, maybe it means taking a risk, pushing through hardship, maybe it's someone else 
            being offended or disliking me for what I do. Although I value this I find it difficult
            <br><br>
            In the book purpose is framed as serving something greater. I definitely have a desire to serve in my life, 
            but it feels like, not right now. At the moment I don't care about service so much. There is just this drive to cast off layers of pretense, get real and be honest about what I want, at least to myself, and start
            acting it out while I have the opportunity. I expect real generosity and service to others, to things greater than me can grow out of that foundation.
            <br><br>
            I also value being connected, to others, to the world, to feel like my experience impacts others and vice versa, that they are enmeshed in some way.
          </p>
          <h2>Resilience</h2>
          <p>
            I found it difficult to really get into the exercise this time, although I could connect to body sensations eventually. The feeling of being knocked down 
            and heavy at the point of failure, searching for how to digest the setback in a constructive way, and the feeling of bouyancy following a big success.
            <br><br>
            The discussion reminded me of something in the previous chapters, this idea of being big enough to contain very strong experiences, both 
            pleasant and unpleasant without them swaying you. I get a lot out of it, I think it helps to be reminded frequently that this is 
            something that is possible to practice.
          </p>
          <h2>Other Musings</h2>
          <p>
            "It takes 3 times as many positive experiences to balance 
            out the effect of one positive experience". There's got to be a reason right? That balance must either be conditioned into us or 
            have served some purpose at some time.
            <br><br>
            Maybe it's because in the current world we live in an environment where our basic needs are often so secure, where there is little risk 
            to our physical safety and basic needs. If we were having to fend for ourselves like our ancestors did it might be 
            advantageous to have that pessimistic weighting. Now that we can afford to take more risks, it takes some effort to override our old
            setting.
